Kentucky Soccer Officials Association provides Louisville area referees the ability to build an online community for soccer referees.  There are a multitude of resources to help each referee grow their skills in the game we love.  The main goal of our website is to recruit and retain soccer officials.  This website includes a hamburger icon with a collapsable menu with a hover color change based on the mouse location.  The hamburger menu changes to a full size large navigation menu with large media queries.  I included different color schemes to help myself navigate CSS and intend to continue work on this project after this course.  The KSOA website also includes a mixture of flex and grid re-alignment based on the current media query.  It starts with flex, then goes to a two-column layout for medium queries, and a three column layout for large queries.  This website includes a form to recruit new referees and displays a message to validate submissions.  

You need to run NPM Install to access this application.

Javascript features include a weather API, regular expressions to check for letters and numbers only in the "interest form", and data saved to an external server from the form.
